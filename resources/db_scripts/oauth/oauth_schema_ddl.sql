-- OAuth2 simulation schema (design only, not wired into the app yet).
-- Postgres. Mirrors this project's real Role enum (common/enums.py):
-- employee, manager, hr_support - not an open-ended list.
--
-- Lives as its own schema (hrb_chatbot_v2_core) INSIDE the shared
-- `hr_chatbot` database, not a standalone employees table in this
-- project's own database. `hr_chatbot` already has a real, populated
-- `hrb_emp_lms.employees` table (shared with hrb_lms_mcp/hrb_emp_assist) -
-- `employee_roles.employee_id` stores that same real id, no duplicated
-- employee rows, no synthetic data.
--
-- Renamed from hrb_chatbot_v2_auth 2026-09-22, alongside creating an
-- empty sibling schema `hrb_chatbot_v2_sessions` (reserved for future
-- conversation/session-state tables, no tables yet - nothing to build
-- until a conversation-memory feature actually exists). Three schemas,
-- one per bounded context, same physical `hr_chatbot` database: this
-- project's own identity/RBAC data (`hrb_chatbot_v2_core`), this
-- project's own future session state (`hrb_chatbot_v2_sessions`), and
-- hrb_lms_mcp's leave data (`hrb_emp_lms`, untouched, not owned by this
-- project) - schema-per-service, a step toward real service isolation
-- even while sharing one physical database.
--
-- No FOREIGN KEY constraints anywhere in this schema - redesigned
-- 2026-09-22, third pass, deliberately. A DB-enforced FK across schemas
-- owned by different services (employee_roles -> hrb_emp_lms.employees)
-- is exactly the tight coupling the "shared database" pattern gets
-- criticized for in real distributed systems: it blocks either service
-- from migrating/sharding/dropping rows independently, and a schema
-- change on either side can break the other silently. Even the FKs
-- entirely within this project's own schema (employee_roles.role_id,
-- client_scopes.client_id) were dropped for consistency - this is a
-- capstone/portfolio project, not a production system with a real
-- data-integrity SLA, so the simpler, more loosely-coupled shape is the
-- better teaching example. Referential lookups still work fine via a
-- plain application-level JOIN (see oauth_sample_data_dml.sql's own
-- verification query) - integrity just isn't DB-enforced.
--
-- Run as: psql -d hr_chatbot -f oauth_schema_ddl.sql
