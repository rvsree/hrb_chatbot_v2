# Backlog

Things identified while building the RAG boilerplate (2026-09-07) that are
real gaps but explicitly **not blocking** current work. Move an item out of
this file into `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md`'s phase list when it's actually picked
up, rather than marking it done in place here.

## Observability

- ~~**No logging around individual backend calls.**~~ Fixed 2026-09-08.
  Confirmed by direct audit that no client logged anything around its
  actual network call - only around a missing API key at construction time,
  or a whole pipeline step finishing. Added
  `common/logging/call_logger.py`'s `log_backend_call()` (a context
  manager - service, operation, duration_ms, status on every line) and
  wired it into all four LLM clients' `ask`/`ask_with_tools`/
  `get_embeddings`, both vector store clients' `upsert`/`query`/`delete`,
  and both metadata store clients' five methods. Verified live, not just
  by reading the code - a real index call now shows
  `[openai] embeddings.create succeeded in 2184.2ms - {'model': ...,
  'text_count': 45}` in the log, where before there was nothing at all
  between "starting to index" and "finished indexing." Deliberately not a
  LangSmith integration - structured consistently enough that swapping one
  in later means changing this one function's body, not every call site.
- **No correlation/request id across log lines.** A single `POST
  /rag/documents/{id}/index` call now produces several log lines (create,
  get, embeddings.create, upsert, set_chunk_ids, update_status - see
  above) but nothing ties them together as "one request" if two requests
  happen to interleave in the logs. Worth adding once this app sees real
  concurrent traffic; not worth it yet at single-user local/demo scale.
- **No retrieval-vs-generation latency breakdown yet** - can't exist until
  Phase 6 (real retrieval + generation) is built. The logging added above
  already reports per-call duration for every LLM and vector-store call
  individually (visible in the logs today), which is what a future
  retrieval-vs-generation metric would be built from - see
  `docs/agent-reference/TESTING-GUIDE.md` for the A/B-comparison pattern that's the
  natural next step once there's a real answer-quality metric to compare.

## LLM providers

- ~~**Anthropic was unhealthy.**~~ Fixed 2026-09-07. Two independent bugs:
  `anthropic==0.40.0` (this project's original, unverified pin) has no
  `.models` attribute at all, confirmed by inspection - the deep health
  check always failed regardless of key validity. Bumped to `1.2.0`,
  matching the sibling project's working install. Separately, `.env`'s
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` carried an erroneous `/v1` suffix (Anthropic's own
  docstring says host-only, opposite of OpenAI) - corrected. Retested live:
  `healthy`, 11 models visible, `chat_model_available: true`.
- ~~**Bedrock as an LLM provider.**~~ Done 2026-09-07 (Phase 9). `BedrockChatClient`
  implementing `BaseLLMClient` via the `Converse` API, wired into `/health`
  alongside OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter. Confirmed with the user: Bedrock
  *as one more provider option*, not adopting Bedrock AgentCore Runtime as
  the hosting platform. One thing surfaced worth remembering: the deep
  health check passed using an ambient personal AWS credential already on
  this machine (`~/.aws/credentials`, identity `BedrockAgentCore`,
  account `418884736369`), not anything this project configured - see
  Phase 9 in `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md` for the full account/permissions finding.
  `ask_with_tools()`'s tool-format conversion is still untested against a
  real tool call.
- **Tavily health check.** `common/clients/web_client/tavily_client.py`
  exists and is wired into `client_gateway.py`, but nothing calls its
  `health_check()` from `/health` - unlike the three LLM providers, it isn't
  an LLM so it doesn't belong under `check_llm()`. Needs its own
  `check_web_search()` (or similar) folded into `check_all_backend_services()`.

## AWS deployment (Phase 10, in progress)

- **Metadata store had no config switch - fixed.** `documents_service.py`,
  `vector_indexer.py`, and `routes_documents.py` all called
  `db_gateway.sqlite()` directly, hardcoded, unlike the vector store's
  `RAG_VECTOR_DB`. Surfaced by deploying to App Runner (no persistent
  local disk) rather than by reading the code. Added
  `db_gateway.metadata_store()` reading a new `RAG_METADATA_STORE` setting
  (`sqlite` default - local dev unchanged; `postgres` for anywhere without
  persistent disk) and switched all three call sites. Done 2026-09-07.
- **Deployed service is temporarily running `RAG_METADATA_STORE=sqlite`
  anyway** - the ephemeral option - because Neon (the chosen hosted
  Postgres) doesn't exist yet, and App Runner refuses to start a service
  whose `RuntimeEnvironmentSecrets` reference a not-yet-existing secret
  ARN. `RAG_VECTOR_DB=pinecone` is already live and persistent. Finish this
  once Neon exists: 5 more Secrets Manager entries
  (`hrb-chatbot/POSTGRES_DB_HOST/PORT/NAME/USER/PASSWORD`), then
  `apprunner.update_service` flipping the env var and adding those secrets
  - config-only, no rebuild. See Phase 10 in `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md` for the
  exact resource ARNs.
- **AWS CLI upgrade stalled, not resolved.** `winget upgrade --id
  Amazon.AWSCLI` (2.0.30 → 2.36.40) got stuck at "Starting package
  install..." with no further progress - almost certainly a UAC elevation
  prompt this non-interactive shell can't answer. Doesn't block anything -
  deployment was scripted via `boto3` instead - but the CLI itself is still
  the old version. Needs a human to run the MSI installer directly and
  click through the UAC prompt.
- **Blocked on the user:** a free Neon Postgres project/database (neon.tech)
  - external signup, not something Claude Code can do on the user's behalf.

## CI/CD & branch strategy (2026-09-08) - see `docs/agent-reference/CICD-BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md`

- **pip-audit triage.** Wired into `ci.yml` as `continue-on-error: true` -
  report-only, not blocking. A real run turned up dozens of pre-existing
  CVEs across `langchain*`/`chromadb`/`starlette`/`pillow`, pinned for
  compatibility long before this scan existed. Needs someone to go
  through the list, upgrade what's safely upgradable (`chromadb` needs
  care - see the Python-3.13 fragility note in `README.md`'s
  Prerequisites), and explicitly accept-with-comment whatever can't move
  yet, before flipping this gate to blocking. See
  `docs/agent-reference/CICD-BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md`'s security-gate section for the exact
  steps.
- **No staging deployment target.** `develop` runs the full test gate but
  deploys nowhere - only `master` triggers `deploy.yml`, against the one
  existing App Runner service. Adding a second, always-on App Runner
  service for `develop` would give a real pre-prod environment, at the
  cost of a second continuous AWS bill. Deliberately not stood up without
  asking - see `docs/agent-reference/CICD-BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md`'s "Deployment targets"
  section for the two options laid out.
- **Docker images are tagged `:latest` only.** No way to redeploy a known-
  good previous image if a new one passes App Runner's own health check
  but is still broken in some way that check can't see - `:latest` is
  overwritten every deploy. Recommended fix: tag every build with
  `:${{ github.sha }}` too. Not implemented yet, deliberately - `deploy.yml`'s
  build command has caused three real, hard-to-diagnose failures before
  (see `AWS-DEVOPS-RUNBOOK.md`), so this needs its own isolated test
  before going anywhere near that line again.
- **GitHub repo settings not configured.** Default branch is still
  `hrb_rag_pipelines`, not `master` - a Settings → Branches action, not a
  `git push`. No branch protection rules exist either (nothing requires
  CI to pass, or a review, before a merge into `develop`/`master`).

## API hardening (same shape as the sibling project's NFR backlog)

- ~~**Upload constraints.**~~ Done in Phase 2 - PDF-only and 20MB-max
  validation in `services/documents_service.py`, verified with a real
  rejected file. Still no per-batch count limit (nothing stops a 500-file
  batch) - worth deciding if it ever matters at this project's scale.
- **Retry / circuit breaker.** No resilience exists for the OpenAI/Anthropic/
  OpenRouter calls or the ChromaDB calls. Same gap as the sibling project;
  same recommendation - a bounded, transient-failures-only retry at the
  client layer, a circuit breaker as a separate later decision. **Not the
  same thing as rate limiting below** - retry/circuit-breaker is about
  *this app* handling a flaky backend gracefully; rate limiting is about
  protecting this app *from* too many callers.
- ~~**Rate limiting.**~~ Done 2026-09-08 -
  `common/rate_limiting/rate_limiter.py`, a fixed-window in-memory limiter
  applied via `Depends(enforce_rate_limit)` to every endpoint that writes
  state or spends money (upload, index, query). Finally gives
  `APP_RATE_LIMITING`/`APP_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS`/`APP_RATE_LIMIT_DURATION`
  a real job - they'd been sitting in `.env` unread since the first
  commit (see the "Orphan config" section below, now out of date on this
  point). Single-process, in-memory only - resets on redeploy, and would
  need a real shared store (Redis) the moment this app scales to more
  than one instance - documented in the module's own docstring, not a
  surprise to discover later.
- **Auth** - still nothing. Genuinely deferred, not overlooked: this is a
  single-user personal project today, and every other item on this list
  (rate limiting, idempotency, versioning) was worth doing without waiting
  for auth to exist first. Worth a real decision before this project ever
  has more than one real user.
- ~~**Versioning.**~~ Done 2026-09-08 - every business endpoint now lives
  under `/v1` (`main.py`'s `include_router(..., prefix="/v1")`).
  `GET /health` deliberately stays unversioned - a liveness/readiness
  probe needs one stable path regardless of API version, matching how
  AWS/Kubernetes health checks are conventionally exempted from an app's
  own versioning scheme.
- **Idempotency.** Done 2026-09-08, **removed 2026-09-13** - the
  `Idempotency-Key` header cache and the separate content-hash
  duplicate-upload check were both deliberately dropped (user decision,
  during the LangChain/LlamaIndex pipeline rewrite on
  `feature-langchain-rag-pipeline`) to simplify the request path while
  that rewrite is in progress. Back on the backlog as a real gap, not
  struck through - a real shared store (Redis) is the planned
  re-implementation once the pipeline rewrite is stable, see
  `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md`'s phase entry.
- ~~**No app-level exception handler / possible info leak in error
  responses.**~~ Fixed 2026-09-08. An audit found two real `json_error(...)`
  calls that interpolated a caught exception's raw `str(error)` directly
  into the client-facing message
  (`routes_documents.py`'s index endpoint, `retrieve_document.py`'s query
  endpoint) - a genuine info-leak risk (a stack-trace fragment, an
  internal path, anything a library's own exception `__str__` happens to
  include). Both now log the full detail server-side and return a
  generic, safe message. `main.py` also gained a global
  `@app.exception_handler(Exception)` as a last-resort safety net for
  anything no individual route handler catches - confirmed by audit that
  none existed before this.
- ~~**No pre-flight backend-readiness check before spending money.**~~
  Fixed 2026-09-08 for the one endpoint that has a real backend
  dependency today - `index_document()` now checks (shallow, free -
  `deep=False`) that the LLM provider and vector store are at least
  configured *before* attempting the real chunk/embed/index call,
  returning a clean 503 instead of letting a config problem surface as a
  raw exception deep in the pipeline. **Deliberately not applied to the
  query endpoint yet** - it's still a pure stub with no real backend call
  to check readiness for, and gating it behind a real API key would break
  in CI, which runs with no secrets at all (see
  `docs/agent-reference/AWS-DEVOPS-RUNBOOK.md`). Add the same check there once Phase 6
  makes a real call.
- **Typed request/response/error contracts on every endpoint**, not just the
  ones built carefully - see `docs/agent-reference/CODING-STANDARDS.md` for the standard
  this is meant to hold to going forward. String fields on request models
  now also carry both a `min_length` and a `max_length` where the
  distinction matters (`RagQueryRequest.query`, `IndexRequest.vector_db`/
  `embedding_model`) - a structural, size-based guardrail, not the
  content-based (prompt-injection, PII) guardrails that remain Phase 7's
  hand-written work.

## Access control (Phase 23, 2026-09-15; identity mechanism replaced Phase 45, 2026-09-20)

- **Real OAuth still not built.** `api/gateway/rbac.py`'s `require_role()`
  reads a caller-supplied `user_profile` sub-object straight from the JSON
  request body (every endpoint, including `GET`/`DELETE`) as-is - a
  deliberate placeholder, trivially spoofable, not a security control
  (self-asserted in the same request it gates - see
  `docs/agent-reference/endpoint-request-response-contracts.md`).
  `common/clients/auth_client/oauth_client.py` is an empty placeholder for
  the real integration.
- ~~**Uploader identity isn't persisted.**~~ **Done, Phase 45:**
  `DocumentRecord`/`DocumentUploadResult` now carry `uploaded_by`
  (`documents_service.create_document()` threads the caller's
  `employee_id` through to a new DB column); `DocumentDeleteResponse`/
  `DocumentDeleteAllResponse` carry `deleted_by` the same way.
- **Rate limiting is still IP-keyed**, not by the identity the gateway now
  resolves - `common/rate_limiting/rate_limiter.py` predates Phase 23.
  Switching the key to `employee_id` (falling back to IP when absent)
  would rate-limit per person instead of per network address.
- **Retrieval is uniform across all three roles** - no per-document
  visibility differences (e.g. a manager-only document) - deferred per
  explicit request when this phase was scoped. Would build on the same
  chunk metadata (`doc_category`/`department`) Phase 19 already added.

## Dead code (Phase 22, found 2026-09-15 during comment cleanup)

- **`PineconeClient.query()`/`.upsert()` and `ChromaClient`'s equivalents
  look unused in the real pipeline.** Indexing (`vector_indexer.py`) and
  retrieval (`retriever.py`) both go through LangChain's own vector store
  objects (`langchain_vector_store.py`'s `get_vector_store()`) since Phase
  17/Phase 4 - confirmed by grepping the whole `src/` tree for any other
  caller of `.query(`/`.upsert(` and finding none. `delete()`/
  `update_metadata()` are still real (used directly by
  `documents_service.py`/`vector_indexer.py`'s supersede-flip), so this
  isn't the whole client, just these two methods (and their
  `BaseVectorDBClient` ABC requirement). Worth confirming and removing in
  a dedicated phase, not fixed here - this was noticed while trimming an
  unrelated docstring, not something this task set out to check.

## Retrieval quality (Phase 20, found 2026-09-14 during live verification)

- **Self-Query's `doc_description` filter only matches exact strings,
  but `doc_description` is deliberately free text** (Phase 19's own
  design - "not a fixed enum, real documents vary too much to hardcode a
  closed list"). Confirmed live: querying "what's my 401k vesting
  schedule" reliably makes Self-Query's LLM parse
  `doc_description="401k"` (it's the example in
  `ai/rag_pipeline/query_retrieval/retriever.py`'s own
  `METADATA_FIELD_INFO`), but a real indexed document's actual extracted
  value was `"401(k) Savings Plan"` - an exact-string mismatch that
  correctly-but-uselessly returns zero chunks, even though clearly
  relevant chunks exist. `doc_category` (extraction picks from a short fixed
  list: policy/regulatory/investment/benefits/other) doesn't have this
  problem - confirmed by isolating it, `doc_category=benefits` alone matched
  real chunks every time. Options for later: a `contain`/fuzzy comparator
  instead of `$eq` for `doc_description` specifically, or re-scoping it
  toward a smaller controlled set the way `doc_category` already is. See
  `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md`'s Phase 20 entry for the full verification
  (field names there are historical - `doc_type`/`doc_classification`,
  renamed to `doc_category`/`doc_description` in Phase 57).

## Data handling

- **PII / sensitive data.** The knowledge base is real HR benefits
  documents. No conscious decision has been made yet about what's logged
  (query text? retrieved chunk contents?) or how long uploaded files and
  their embeddings are retained.
- **No `.env.example`.** Only a real `.env` exists in this repo - there's no
  template a new contributor (or a fresh clone) could copy and fill in
  without seeing real values. Worth creating one, redacted, the way the
  sibling project's `.env.example` documents every setting name with a
  comment on what reads it.

## Cleanup done 2026-09-21

- Removed `resources/db_scripts/` entirely (postgres/ and sqlite/, 13
  files) - described an unrelated, never-built project design (`coco`
  database, `chat_sessions`/`policy_versions`/`leave_rules`/`agent_tasks`/
  `user_feedback` tables, `src/app/common/db_scripts/...` paths that don't
  exist in this repo). Zero overlap with the real schema (`documents`/
  `chunks`, built via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` in `sqlite_client.py`/
  `postgres_client.py`) and zero references anywhere in `src/` or current
  docs - orphaned scaffolding from a different project, not this one's.
- Removed `README_TEST.md` - stale and factually wrong (old `/v1/rag/...`
  prefix, removed header-based auth from Phase 23, a "Phase 6 stub"
  reference long superseded). Fully replaced by `docs/agent-reference/TESTING-GUIDE.md`
  (pytest) and `postman/hrb_chatbot.postman_collection.json` (manual/
  curl-style testing), which the file's own last line already pointed to.
- Removed `postman/hrb_chatbot.postman_collection_v1.json` - a stale
  duplicate collection using a defunct `/index/v1/rag/documents` routing
  scheme, confusing to have alongside the real, actively-maintained
  collection.
- Removed `resources/kb_docs/text/indexing_batch_payload.json` - a sample
  payload for an API shape (`namespace`/`title`/`tags` fields) that was
  never this project's actual contract.
- Removed `src/hrb_chatbot/services/rag_service.py` - a literal one-line
  pass-through (`return await pipeline.answer_query(params)`) with no
  logic of its own, unlike `services/documents_service.py` (real logic:
  content-hash dedup, supersedes handling, file validation), which keeps
  its service layer. `api/rag/retrieve_document.py` now calls
  `ai/rag_pipeline/pipeline.py` directly - see `CLAUDE.md`'s architecture
  section for the updated request flow.
- **Not removed, flagged for the user's own call:** `infra/AgentCore
  Installation and Run Guide.md` (real forward-looking AWS Bedrock
  AgentCore deployment notes, not obviously stale) and
  `resources/kb_docs/text/*.txt` / `resources/kb_docs/word/*.docx`
  (real alternate-format copies of the 6 source PDFs, unreferenced by any
  code but plausibly intentional reference material, not junk like the
  payload JSON above).

## Cleanup done 2026-09-07

- Removed 6 Microsoft Word lock files (`~$MC ....docx`, 162 bytes each,
  under `resources/kb_docs/word/`) - temp files Word creates while a
  document is open, never real content, should never have been committed.
- Removed `resources/postgres/` - a byte-for-byte duplicate of
  `resources/db_scripts/postgres/` (confirmed with `diff -rq`, zero
  differences). Kept the `db_scripts/postgres` copy, matching the sibling
  `db_scripts/sqlite/` naming already in use.

## Orphan config - flagged, not removed (touches `.env`, your call)

Checked every `.env` variable against the actual source - these are
declared but read by nothing:

- `APP_BASE_URL`, `APP_APP_NAME`, `APP_ENVIRONMENT`, `APP_DEBUG`,
  `APP_CSRF_PROTECTION` - still orphaned, tracked above as
  "`app_settings.py`/`app_gateway.py` don't exist yet."
- ~~`APP_RATE_LIMITING`, `APP_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS`,
  `APP_RATE_LIMIT_DURATION`~~ - no longer orphaned as of 2026-09-08, now
  read by `common/rate_limiting/rate_limiter.py` - see the "Rate limiting"
  entry above.
- `OPENAI_RAG_MODEL` - not read anywhere; only `OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL` and
  `OPENAI_EMBED_MODEL` are.
- `ANTHROPIC_LLM_ENABLED` - not read anywhere; nothing gates on it.
- `TAVILY_SEARCH_ENABLED`, `TAVILY_MAX_RESULTS`, `TAVILY_SEARCH_DEPTH`,
  `TAVILY_INCLUDE_ANSWER` - `TavilyClient.search()` takes these as function
  parameters with hardcoded defaults, not as env-driven settings, so these
  four `.env` lines currently do nothing.

Also noted, not touched: `common/logging/log_helper.py` still has its own
broken import (`agent_log_tags` module doesn't exist) - this was an
explicit earlier decision to keep as-is for later, not a new finding.

## Guardrails / Evaluation / Observability follow-up (Phases 7-8, 2026-09-22)

- **3 of 6 KB documents not indexed.** 401(k), Unpaid TimeOff, and Sedgwick
  Unpaid Timeoff are missing from the vector store - leftover from the
  earlier live-DB-deletion incident, only 3 PDFs got re-uploaded
  afterward. Found via the DeepEval harness scoring 0.00 on a 401(k)
  question. Re-upload is simple, not done - your call on priority.
- **DeepEval CI gate not wired up.** The scoring harness
  (`golden_dataset_harness.py`) exists and is verified live; the actual
  PASS/REVIEW/BLOCK threshold job (`docs/agent-reference/CICD-BRANCHING-STRATEGY.md`'s
  practical-significance bar) isn't hooked into a CI workflow yet.
- **PII in a query gets blocked, not masked.** `self check input`'s LLM
  judgment flags SSN-like content before the dedicated `mask sensitive
  data on input` rail gets a turn (rails run in sequence). Defensible
  (safer), but different from "mask, don't block" - flagged for a
  decision if the stricter behavior isn't wanted.
- **Gate 2 (document-level ACL) and Gate 4 (context grading) still
  unbuilt.** Both explicitly out of scope for Phase 7 - real gaps in the
  six-gate framework, not started.
- **LangSmith stays off**, by design - re-enable (`.env`'s
  `LANGSMITH_ENABLED`) specifically when single/multi-agentic-rag work
  begins, per the agreed trace-budget cadence.

## MCP integration & cross-project schema standardization (2026-09-22)

- **`hrb_lms_mcp` integration done as a prototype - Phase 49.** Real,
  running FastMCP server, now actually called live from this project via
  `ai/rag_pipeline/tools/mcp_tools/`, manual keyword routing (not ReAct
  yet) in `pipeline.answer_query()`. See Phase 49 in this file for the
  full spec, the two real dependency bugs found (`mcp` version pin,
  `python-multipart` bump), and the live verification.
- **A third sibling project found**: `hrb_emp_assist`
  (`C:\workspace\poc\2026\hrb_emp_assist`) is the real "Status: Production"
  MCP client `hrb_lms_mcp`'s own README names as its primary consumer -
  Python/FastAPI, ReAct Multi-Agent, MCP Integration already built,
  version 2.0. This looks like the mature version of what `hrb_chatbot_v2`
  is a from-scratch educational rebuild of. Worth treating as a reference
  for "how was this actually built the first time" during future
  ReAct/agentic-rag phases, not just for schema comparison.
- **`hrb_emp_assist`'s missing DDL/DML *files* don't mean missing schema -
  corrected 2026-09-22 after actually querying the live Postgres server**,
  not just the file tree. `coco_schema_extensions.sql`/`coco_schema_dml.sql`/
  `coco_schema_missing_tables.sql`/`coco_schema_missing_tables_dml.sql`
  genuinely don't exist on disk anywhere in the project (confirmed via
  file search) - but the database objects they were meant to create
  **do exist and are live**: `disability_rules`, `retirement_rules`,
  `healthcare_rules`, `tuition_rules`, and the rest of the 9 "missing"
  tables are real tables in the `coco` Postgres database today. The real
  gap is narrower than first reported: those 9 tables are all at **0
  rows** - the DDL ran (or was run manually) at some point, the DML
  (the actual rules data) never landed, or was cleared. `hr_chatbot_schema_hitl.sql`
  (the 5th script) does exist on disk. Not touched - that project's own
  gap to close, flagged here only because it surfaced while checking.
- **The "shared database" design is not abandoned - it's live.** Corrected
  2026-09-22: the local Postgres server hosts 4 real databases -
  `hrb_chatbot_v2` (this project's own, 1 table), `hr_chatbot`, `coco`,
  and `postgres`. `hr_chatbot` has a `hrb_emp_lms` schema (61 employees -
  the 58 original plus the 3 this session added) and a `public` schema
  with real chat history (1,500 rows), sessions (109), HITL escalations
  (66) - `hrb_lms_mcp` and `hrb_emp_assist`/`hrb_copilot` are already
  sharing this one physical database today, split by schema, confirmed by
  querying it directly, not by reading a setup script's comments. Two
  more schemas found this way, undocumented anywhere read so far:
  `app_tracking` (mcp_server_registry/mcp_tools_registry/agent_registry/
  retry_queue - real MCP/agent observability tables, all empty) and
  `state_mngmt` (agent_entities/agent_ltm, has real data) - worth knowing
  about before designing this project's own future agent/memory work, to
  avoid reinventing a schema that already exists next door.
- **OAuth2 extended for app-to-app, alongside the existing human-to-app
  design** (`resources/db_scripts/oauth/oauth_schema_ddl.sql`): a new
  `client_scopes` table gives each `oauth_clients` row (a registered
  caller, not a person) a scoped allowlist - e.g. this project's own
  `hrb-lms-mcp-client` gets `mcp:get_leave_balance`/`mcp:get_leave_history`
  only, read-only until deliberately widened. `hrb_lms_mcp`'s own auth
  today is a single optional `X-API-Key` (not real OAuth2) - this table is
  this project's own record of who's allowed to call out, independent of
  how `hrb_lms_mcp` checks it on its side. Design only, not wired into
  actual token-issuing code yet, same status as the human-to-app half.
- **Known gap, not closed**: MCP-routed answers (Phase 49) skip the output
  guardrail (`check_output()`) - written for LLM-generated text, and
  running it would add a full extra LLM call to a path whose entire point
  is avoiding one. Worth a deliberate decision once real PII fields show
  up in an MCP tool's response, not assumed safe forever.
- **`ai/agents/` and `ai/rag_pipeline/tools/`** (both previously empty
  placeholders) - `tools/mcp_tools/` is no longer empty (Phase 49);
  `ai/agents/` still is, reserved for the actual ReAct orchestration that
  replaces Phase 49's keyword-matching stand-in.
- **Employee ID convention standardized to match `hrb_lms_mcp`'s real data**,
  2026-09-22: this project's `E00001`-style test identities (golden
  dataset era) are now `EMP0xx`/`MGR0xx`, matching `hrb_lms_mcp`'s real
  `employees` table exactly (`EMP001`-`EMP050`, `MGR001`-`MGR005`). Updated
  everywhere: `resources/db_scripts/oauth/*.sql`, 3 test files, Postman,
  README, `docs/agent-reference/endpoint-request-response-contracts.md`. Full suite still
  151 passing after the rename.
- **`hrb_lms_mcp`'s own sample data has an internal inconsistency** -
  3 test employees (`emp_12345`/`emp_67890`/`emp_11111`, lowercase,
  different shape) alongside the dominant `EMP0xx` convention, per that
  file's own comment tied to `tests/test_mcp_tools_integration.py`.
  Flagged, not touched - that project's own call, and the referencing test
  file wasn't verified safe to rename against.
- **A real cross-database FK limitation found while standardizing**: this
  project's OAuth sketch and `hrb_lms_mcp`'s employees table are different
  Postgres databases - a `manager_id` can't literally foreign-key across
  that boundary. `oauth_sample_data_dml.sql`'s new rows (`EMP051`/`EMP052`/
  `MGR006`, added to both projects' sample data for a shared identity)
  leave `manager_id` `NULL` here for that reason - only `hrb_lms_mcp`'s own
  copy of the same rows has a real, resolvable `manager_id`.
- **Superseded, 2026-09-22 (same day, later in the session)**: the note
  above about the shared-database direction "looking abandoned" was wrong
  and is now moot either way - see the next section. This project's own
  copies of `hr_chatbot_schema*.sql` are still deleted, but that no longer
  matters: Phase 50's OAuth2 schema and MCP registry both write directly
  into the real, live `hr_chatbot` database now, not a planned one.
- **Gate 2 (document ACL) plan sketched, not started** - see the six-gate
  framework note above; needs a decision on role-gated vs. department-gated
  document visibility before a spec is written.

## Schema/data work completed, 2026-09-22 (Phases 50-51 + OAuth2 redesign)

Five tasks, done in dependency order, each tested/verified live against
the real `hr_chatbot` Postgres database and the real `hrb_lms_mcp` server -
not simulated:

1. **DB model diagram** (`docs/dev-reference/db-model-overview.html`) - built first, to
   design against, then kept accurate to the final state below.
2. **OAuth2 schema redesigned** to reuse real data instead of duplicating
   it: new `hrb_chatbot_v2_auth` Postgres schema, living inside the
   shared `hr_chatbot` database (not a new database, not this project's
   own). `employee_roles.employee_id` is a real FK into
   `hrb_emp_lms.employees` - Postgres schemas in the same database CAN
   foreign-key across each other (unlike across separate databases, the
   real limitation found last time this was attempted). Applied for
   real: `EMP051`/`EMP052`/`MGR006` now have real roles
   (`hr_support`/`employee`/`manager`) in the live database, verified via
   a real join query, not just the SQL files on disk.
3. **MCP registry at startup (Phase 50)** - reuses `hr_chatbot.app_tracking`'s
   existing `mcp_server_registry`/`mcp_tools_registry`/`mcp_server_connections`
   tables (found already existing before this session, previously all
   empty - the exact pattern from the user's own v1 project,
   `hrb_emp_assist`). New `common/clients/db_client/mcp_registry_client.py`
   + `common/observability/mcp_registry_startup.py`, wired into `main.py`'s
   `lifespan`. Verified live: all 6 real `hrb_lms_mcp` tools registered on
   a real startup run. **Three real CHECK-constraint violations found and
   fixed live** (existing tables restrict `connection_type`/`status`/
   `connection_status` to fixed value lists not documented anywhere,
   only discoverable by inserting) - see Phase 50's detail in
   `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md`.
4. **NFR-specific golden dataset (Phase 51)** -
   `resources/golden_dataset/nfr_golden_dataset.json` (14 cases: prompt
   injection, PII, jailbreak, toxic content, and 4 false-positive
   controls) + `ai/rag_pipeline/evaluations/nfr_golden_dataset_harness.py`,
   run live against the real `check_input()` guardrail. **Two real
   findings, not assumptions**: email/credit-card PII gets *masked*, not
   blocked, unlike SSN (dataset corrected to match verified behavior);
   and a genuine false-positive bug - `EMP052` gets misclassified as
   `<PERSON>` by Presidio's NER recognizer and masked. Kept as a
   documented `known_issue` in the dataset itself, not fixed (out of this
   task's scope) and not hidden by changing the expected outcome to match
   the bug.
5. **Main golden dataset (`golden_dataset.json`) checked, needs no
   update** - zero `employee_id`/identity references in it; it's purely
   query-to-answer pairs about document content, fully decoupled from who's
   asking. Confirmed by direct search, not assumed.

Full suite: 161 passed (2 new unit tests for the registry). Both
eval-marked harnesses (`pytest -m eval`): 2 passed live, including the
new NFR one, real LLM/guardrail calls both times.

**Follow-up, same day: all 3 foreign keys removed from `hrb_chatbot_v2_auth`**
(`employee_roles.employee_id` -> `hrb_emp_lms.employees`, `employee_roles.role_id`
-> `roles`, `client_scopes.client_id` -> `oauth_clients`) - user-directed,
real-world reasoning: a DB-enforced FK across schemas owned by different
services is the exact coupling the "shared database" pattern gets
criticized for (blocks independent migration/sharding, a schema change
on either side can silently break the other). Dropped live
(`ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT`, verified the app-level JOIN still
works identically), `oauth_schema_ddl.sql` updated to match, and
`docs/dev-reference/db-model-overview.html` updated with the reasoning. The 2 FKs
purely within this project's own schema were dropped too, for
consistency, not because they had the same coupling problem - simpler is
the better teaching example for a capstone project. **Not touched**: the
real FK on the shared `app_tracking.mcp_server_connections.server_id ->
mcp_server_registry.server_id` (Phase 50) - those tables are reused
infrastructure this project doesn't own, not this project's call to
redesign.

**Follow-up, same day: schema-per-service bounded-context isolation,
user-directed.** `hrb_chatbot_v2_auth` renamed to `hrb_chatbot_v2_core`
(a more accurate name - it's this project's own identity/RBAC data, not
just auth), and a new, deliberately empty `hrb_chatbot_v2_sessions`
schema created for future conversation/session-state tables - created
ahead of any table, not retrofitted after one lands somewhere less
isolated. Three bounded-context schemas in the one shared `hr_chatbot`
database: `hrb_chatbot_v2_core` (this project, identity),
`hrb_chatbot_v2_sessions` (this project, reserved for session state),
`hrb_emp_lms` (hrb_lms_mcp's own, untouched) - each schema owned by
exactly one service, matching DDD bounded-context conventions even while
physically sharing one Postgres instance. Applied live (`ALTER SCHEMA
RENAME`/`CREATE SCHEMA`), verified data/queries still work identically,
`oauth_schema_ddl.sql`/`oauth_sample_data_dml.sql`/`docs/dev-reference/db-model-overview.html`
all updated to match.

**Real finding while answering how the MCP auth key is configured**:
`hrb_lms_mcp`'s own `.env` has a real, non-empty `API_KEY` set, and its
README documents `X-API-Key` header auth as "optional, configurable" -
but the actual current source code has **zero enforcement of it
anywhere** (checked the whole `src/` tree; only a stale compiled `.pyc`
from an apparently-deleted `mcp_controller.py` still references the
header). The key is configured but dead - not wired into any request
path today. `hrb_chatbot_v2`'s own `HRB_LMS_MCP_API_KEY` is empty in
`.env`, so this project's real calls send no `X-API-Key` header at all,
which is why Phase 49/50's live calls worked without one. Not this
project's bug to fix (a different repo), flagged here since it's
directly relevant to "is this call actually authenticated" - it isn't.

**Superseded, same day (Phase 53): the dead X-API-Key gap above is
closed for real.** Real OAuth2 client-credentials now runs both sides -
`hrb_lms_mcp` issues and enforces signed JWTs (`POST /oauth/token`,
`BearerAuthMiddleware` on `/mcp`), `hrb_chatbot_v2` acquires and caches
one. Verified live both directions: no token -> real 401, wrong secret ->
real 401, valid credentials -> real signed JWT -> real authenticated
call succeeds. Full detail, including the two real repos' worth of new
files, in `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md`'s Phase 53.

**Planned, not started: Phase 52, an analytics MCP server** for
aggregate/historical HR questions (leave-utilization trends, attrition,
benefits-cost trends) that Phase 49's per-employee tools can't answer -
researched (WebSearch) against real 2026 NL2SQL-MCP patterns from
Oracle/Microsoft/Google Cloud. Parking-lot spec only in
`docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md` - real spec work deferred until ReAct
orchestration exists to route to it, per the user's own sequencing.

## Conversation memory (Phase 58, 2026-09-25)

- **Move conversation history off in-process memory onto a real cache
  DB.** `ai/pre_processing/conversation_memory.py`'s `_CONVERSATIONS` dict
  is deliberately in-memory for now (user-directed: "in-memory for now,
  will plan to expand this to cache db later") - lost on every restart,
  and doesn't survive across multiple worker processes if this app is
  ever scaled beyond one. A real move (Redis or similar) would swap the
  module's internals only; `load_history()`/`save_turn()`/
  `new_conversation_id()`'s signatures are already the only thing
  `pipeline.py`/`orchestration_agent.py` depend on.
- **No API to list/inspect/clear a conversation's history.** A caller can
  only add to it via a query; nothing lets them see what's stored or
  reset it mid-conversation. Not asked for yet.
- **MCP-routed answers (leave balance/history) aren't added to
  conversation history**, even when `enable_conversation_memory` is on -
  `pipeline.py`'s `try_route_to_mcp()` early-return bypasses
  `generate_answer()` entirely, which is the only place a turn gets
  saved. A follow-up referencing an MCP-answered turn won't have it in
  context. See Phase 58's own spec in `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md`.

## Process

- ~~**No test suite configured.**~~ Added 2026-09-08 - `pytest` +
  `pytest-asyncio` (`requirements-dev.txt`), 20 tests across chunking,
  embedding, indexing (the insert/update/stale-chunk-cleanup logic
  specifically, the highest-value case), the RAG query stub's contract,
  and a reference A/B-comparison pattern - see `docs/agent-reference/TESTING-GUIDE.md` for
  what's covered and why, and the fake-based pattern
  (`tests/conftest.py`) to extend once the hand-written pipeline exists.
  **Linter/formatter still not configured** - `ruff` is set up for the
  sibling `w1_agentic_foundations` project but not this one; still worth a
  conscious decision, same "don't let this become `crewai_app_demo`"
  reasoning as before.
- ~~**Dockerfile is unverified.**~~ Verified 2026-09-07, once Docker Desktop
  was actually running: build, run, and `HEALTHCHECK` all confirmed. Two
  real bugs were caught and fixed in the process, not just "it built":
  `python-magic-bin` (Windows-only) doesn't install on Linux - swapped for
  `python-magic` + `libmagic1` in the image; and `/srv` (and therefore the
  relative `data/` path ChromaDB/SQLite/uploads all write under) wasn't
  writable by the non-root container user - fixed by chowning `data/`
  specifically, not the whole image, before switching to that user.
- **Spec-Driven Development (SDD) adopted 2026-09-14** - see `CLAUDE.md`'s
  SDD section. Every phase picked up from here on needs a written, reviewed
  spec (a `Spec:` sub-list in its `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md` bullet, via
  `/spec-new`) before implementation starts - this backlog is where planned
  work is tracked, but an item moving from here into an active phase should
  get a spec first, not go straight to code. No new `specs/`/`adr/` folder -
  everything lives in the existing `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md`/`docs/agent-reference/FAQ.md`
  convention, plus new tooling under `.claude/` (skills, hooks, one
  `implementer` subagent).
- **Action item, deliberately not decided yet (2026-09-14): LangChain vs.
  LlamaIndex, which does what, going forward.** Surfaced while researching
  Phase 17 (moving indexing from LlamaIndex to LangChain's `index()`) -
  the common real-world pattern is actually the opposite split ("LlamaIndex
  for ingestion/indexing - its documented strength - LangChain for
  orchestration"), which cuts against Phase 17's direction. User has asked
  to revisit this later rather than resolve it now - Phase 17 proceeds as
  already spec'd in the meantime. Whoever picks this up next should read
  Phase 17's spec and its "not carried over" note in `CLAUDE.md` first.

## Candidate future use case: unpaid-leave benefits-lapse notification (proposed 2026-10-02, not decided)

User-proposed use case, captured here per their own request - not refined
into a spec, not started, and not yet decided whether this gets built,
narrowed, or dropped. Revisit before doing anything else with it.

- **The use case as proposed:** an employee goes on unpaid leave. They may
  still owe their own share of health-benefit premiums for the plan year
  they enrolled in, since payroll deduction stops during unpaid leave. If
  unpaid, their policy lapses within 30 days. The system should notify
  affected employees by email before that happens. Needs sample data: 10-15
  employees, and an enrollment table covering 100+ employees' benefit
  elections per calendar year, across real US unpaid-leave types (FMLA,
  personal leave of absence, military/USERRA leave, workers'-comp-related
  leave - each has different real-world premium-continuation rules the
  30-day constant above oversimplifies).
- **Separate question raised in the same request:** HR also uploads
  documents containing employee and health-policy information that need
  entity extraction - should that use NLP (rule-based/NER) rather than an
  LLM?
- **Review findings (full discussion in this session's transcript, not
  reproduced in full here):**
  - The eligibility/deadline decision logic is pure date arithmetic - no
    LLM belongs in that path. Recommendation: a scheduled batch job /
    rules engine, not a RAG or agentic feature, and not part of
    `ai/rag_pipeline/` at all.
  - Even the notification email text is a debatable LLM use - a wrong
    date or dollar amount in a benefits-lapse notice is a real-stakes
    mistake. A plain string template may be the safer choice over an LLM
    call here. Phase 63's `build_benefits_lapse_warning_prompt()`
    (`ai/prompts/notification_prompts.py`) exists as the requested
    illustrative example only, not as a recommendation to use it.
  - Entity extraction method should depend on actual document structure,
    not be decided upfront - rule-based/NER for fixed-template forms,
    LLM extraction (see `build_entity_extraction_prompt()`, same file as
    above) for free-text documents, either way routed through this
    project's existing PII-masking guardrails (Phase 7) before anything
    sensitive reaches a log or a prompt.
  - Open architecture question, not resolved: does employee/enrollment
    data live in a new table in this project's own database, or in
    `hrb_lms_mcp` (already the system of record this project queries for
    leave balance/history via MCP, Phase 49)? Duplicating employee data
    here would cut against the "no duplicated employee data" principle
    already established in the OAuth2 schema design (see
    `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md` Phase 50/53 and
    `docs/dev-reference/database/db-model-overview.html`).
  - Suggested sequencing if this moves forward: (1) decide where the data
    lives, (2) build the deterministic eligibility logic first, with real
    test coverage, zero LLM involvement, (3) decide and record the email
    approach (template vs. LLM) explicitly rather than defaulting to one,
    (4) only then pick an entity-extraction method, once real sample HR
    documents are in hand to evaluate against.
- **Not done:** no sample employee/enrollment dataset, no new database
  table, no notification workflow, no scheduled job, no real email
  sending. A first pass at this also added a prompt template
  (`build_benefits_lapse_warning_prompt()`) parameterized to this exact
  use case's fields - flagged by the user as implementing a piece of an
  undecided use case regardless of being "just a prompt," and removed the
  same session. Nothing from this discussion is implemented anywhere.

## Candidate future requirement: Analytics domain agent needs historical data (proposed 2026-10-03, sequencing confirmed 2026-10-05)

Surfaced while confirming multi-agentic-rag's domain-agent taxonomy (see
`docs/dev-reference/react_agents/multi-agentic-rag-fit-plan.html`, Decision
2 and "What Decision 2 Opens Up"). Not started, not scheduled - but the
*order* of work is now confirmed, driven by a real use case (below), not
assumed generically anymore.

- **Confirmed driving use case (2026-10-05): Caregiver leave approval,
  human-in-the-loop.** In practice, HR benefits reviews whether an employee
  requesting Caregiver leave has already availed the same leave type (e.g.
  STD/LTD) in the last 12 months before approving. This needs data from
  **both** stores, not one: `HRB_LMS_OPS_DB` (live/current leave records -
  what `GetLeaveHistory`, Phase 49, already reads) **and**
  `HRB_LMS_ANALYTICS_DB` (historical/archived records) - a case closed and
  archived into Analytics could still fall inside a 12-month lookback
  window that Ops alone wouldn't show. Confirmed sequencing: **Ops DB
  dataset first, Analytics DB dataset second, HITL build third.**
- **Ops DB dataset (do first):** 30-50 employees with real leave records
  linked to the Ops DB table - `GetLeaveHistory`'s mechanism already works
  today, it just has almost no real data behind it (a handful of test
  employees, not 30-50). **Open, not decided:** whether these are new
  leave records added to *existing* `hrb_emp_lms` employees, or a new
  employee set - the former matches this project's own "no duplicated
  employee data" principle (OAuth schema design) and is the default
  assumption until confirmed otherwise. Also open: the actual mix of leave
  types/patterns needed for a believable demo (some employees with recent
  STD/LTD, some without, so the HITL check has real cases to differ on).
- **Analytics DB dataset (do second):** still what the original ask below
  covers - 100+ historical records for trend-style NL2SQL queries. Now
  understood to be a related but separate dataset from the Ops DB one, not
  interchangeable with it - Ops answers "has this one employee taken this
  leave," Analytics answers trend/aggregate questions across employees.
- **HITL build (do third, after both datasets exist):** the actual
  Caregiver-leave-approval workflow - gathers the employee's Ops+Analytics
  leave history, reads any supporting documentation, and pauses for a
  human (HR benefits) decision. **DeepAgents scoped-adoption decision
  (2026-10-05):** use DeepAgents specifically for this case-prep agent
  (document reading + multi-source gathering is exactly what it's for) -
  not for Vector KB/LMS Ops/SQL DB, which stay plain bounded lookups. The
  pause-for-approval mechanism itself is plain LangGraph `interrupt()`,
  not a DeepAgents-exclusive feature.
- **Original ask, still accurate:** an Analytics domain agent (NL2SQL over
  benefits-cost/leave-pattern trends) needs 100+ historical records to
  demonstrate against - real data, not a handful of rows, so a trend query
  has something to actually aggregate. Maps to Phase 52 (planned, not
  started, per `docs/dev-reference/mcp/mcp-integration-overview.html`) -
  `hrb_lms_analytics` exists in the DB design doc
  (`docs/dev-reference/database/db-model-overview.html`) as a read-only
  MCP-accessed store, not built.
- **Still open, unrelated to this item:** whether the unpaid-leave
  benefits-lapse use case above shares any of this same dataset - not
  assumed; conflating them without checking would risk baking one use
  case's data shape into a different one's demo data.
- **Not done:** no schema, no data in either store, no MCP server for
  Analytics, no domain agents, no HITL workflow.

## Multi-agentic-rag follow-ups (confirmed gaps after Phase 64, 2026-10-04)

Phase 64 (`docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md`) shipped the real Planner/
Orchestration/Reviewer Agent graph. These are the real, verified-against-
the-actual-code gaps left after that - none started. Listed in a sensible
pickup order (cheap/no-dependency items first, items that build on each
other grouped together), not by how they were raised in conversation.

1. ~~**No per-agent model tiering - cost reduction never actually
   built.**~~ Done, Phase 65 (2026-10-04). `planner_agent._build_llm()`
   reads a new `OPENAI_PLANNER_MODEL` setting, falling back to the
   existing `OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL` when unset - scoped to the Planner only,
   per this item's own suggested fix. `.env` carries the new var
   commented out; no real cheaper model picked (a separate cost/quality
   call for the user to make).
2. ~~**Blind spot - no cost/token logging on any agent LLM call.**~~ Done,
   Phase 66 (2026-10-04), combined with #3 (same three call sites).
   `log_backend_call()` + a `response.usage_metadata` token-count log line
   (verified live before writing - a real field, not guessed) now wrap
   `planner_agent.py`/`reviewer_agent.py`/`orchestration_agent.py`'s
   `ainvoke()` calls, same pattern `openai_client.py` already used.
3. ~~**Blind spot - no timeout on any agent LLM call or graph node.**~~
   Done, Phase 66 (2026-10-04). `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=
   AGENT_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS)` (30s) wraps the same three call sites as
   #2. An `asyncio.TimeoutError` surfaces as an uncaught 500 today - a
   dedicated error code is a follow-up if timeouts turn out to happen
   often in practice, not assumed necessary yet.
4. ~~**Golden dataset has no multi-part questions, and multi-agentic-rag
   was never validated against it.**~~ Done, Phase 67 (2026-10-04). Added
   `multi-agent-same-domain-01` (same-domain compound, 401k+tuition) and
   `multi-agent-cross-domain-01` (KB + live leave-balance) to
   `golden_dataset.json`, plus a live test
   (`test_multi_agent_pipeline_golden_cases.py`) that runs both through
   `run_multi_agent()` on every `pytest -m eval`. **Found and fixed a real
   local-environment gap along the way, unrelated to multi-agentic-rag
   itself:** only 3 of the 6 KB PDFs the golden dataset assumes were
   actually indexed locally - traced down to confirm it affected genai-rag
   too (not an agent-code bug), fixed by re-ingesting the missing 3 PDFs
   through the real upload endpoint. See Phase 67's own Verified block in
   RAG-ROADMAP.md for the full trace.
5. ~~**Query decomposition (Phase 5.1) is still a 0-byte placeholder.**~~
   Resolved, Phase 68 (2026-10-04) - **no separate component built**, by
   live evidence: once #4's indexing gap was fixed, the Planner split the
   same-domain compound case into two correctly-focused `vector_kb_agent`
   tasks with zero prompt changes. Decision and evidence recorded in
   `query_decompose.py`'s own docstring. Still open: genai-rag's own non-
   agentic pipeline has no equivalent splitting mechanism - a separate,
   unraised question.
6. ~~**DeepEval harness is generic but has never been pointed at the
   agentic pipelines.**~~ Done, Phase 69 (2026-10-04). Two new test-local
   adapters (matching the existing `ask_genai_rag()` pattern) point
   `score_case()` at `run_agent()` and `run_multi_agent()`. Needed a real
   fix first, not a workaround: neither function exposed the raw tool/
   domain-agent output text needed for a meaningful groundedness check -
   added `tool_outputs`/`agent_result_texts` to each function's return
   dict (additive, no public API contract change).
7. **Multi-agentic-rag's Planner still never reads prior turns back into
   reasoning - still open.** `multi_agent_pipeline.run_multi_agent()`
   saves a turn (now durably, see #8) but never calls `load_history()` -
   every call reasons fresh, so "what about last year's number" won't
   resolve correctly for multi-agentic-rag specifically. Single-agentic-rag
   does NOT have this gap - `orchestration_agent.run_agent()` already
   loads and seeds history into its own messages, unchanged by Phase 76.
   **Sequencing note:** this item's own text originally said #8 (storage)
   should wait until after this one was fixed ("no point persisting
   history that reasoning doesn't use yet") - the user explicitly directed
   the opposite order on 2026-10-05, and #8 is now done. Fix still needed:
   thread `conversation_memory.load_history()`'s result into the Planner's
   prompt (and optionally the Reviewer's) in `multi_agent_pipeline.py`.
8. ~~**Conversation storage is in-memory only (STM), no LTM, no
   metadata.**~~ Done, Phase 76 (2026-10-05). `conversation_memory.py` is
   now backed by a real Postgres table (`conversation_turns`, via the new
   `ConversationStore` client) - survives restarts, STM and LTM are the
   same durable store (a fast/durable two-tier split is deferred to a
   future Redis migration, user's explicit choice - Postgres now, Redis
   later, not built as a fake two-tier system today). `employee_id` is
   now recorded per turn (wasn't before) - found needed this while
   designing the delete-my-conversation NFR endpoint (also shipped this
   phase), so deletion can be scoped to the caller's own data. No richer
   metadata (which-agent-answered, token/cost, latency) added - still a
   real gap if that level of detail is wanted later.
9. ~~**Web-search agent (Tavily) was never built as an agent, only as a raw
   client.**~~ Done, Phase 70 (2026-10-04). New `ai/agents/domain_agents/
   web_search_agent.py` wraps the existing `get_client_gateway().tavily()`
   client; added as the Planner's 5th routing option
   (`PLANNER_SYSTEM_PROMPT` describes it as external/current information,
   explicitly distinct from `vector_kb_agent`'s internal-policy scope) and
   as a 5th node/edge in the graph. Live-verified with a real Tavily call
   (current IRS mileage rate question) routed correctly end to end.

Items 7 and 8 above are intentionally on hold (2026-10-04) - explicit user
instruction to pick them up later, after items 1-6 and 9 (done, see above).

Related, already tracked separately above (not repeated here): per-
domain-agent evals / "Reviewer Agent also does evals" (Option A from
`multi-agentic-rag-fit-plan.html`) - not built, Phase 64's Reviewer only
merges; SQL DB Agent / LMS Analytics Agent real logic - blocked on the Ops
DB / Analytics DB datasets in the section above this one, already
sequenced.

## Caching follow-ups (confirmed gaps after Phase 77/78, 2026-10-05)

**Query-time embedding caching was not built, flagged not silently
dropped.** Phase 77 caches ingestion-side embeddings only
(`embedding_generator.generate_embeddings()`) - query embeddings happen
inside LangChain's own `OpenAIEmbeddings` object (`langchain_vector_store
.py::get_embeddings()`), called internally by `Chroma`/`PineconeVectorStore
`'s own `similarity_search()`. There's no explicit "embed the query" step
in `retriever.py` to wrap directly - closing this gap needs a small
`CachingEmbeddings` class subclassing LangChain's `Embeddings` interface
(`embed_query()`/`embed_documents()`, plus their async variants
`aembed_query()`/`aembed_documents()` - both need covering, not just one,
since LangChain's own default async implementations just thread-wrap the
sync ones unless overridden), reusing the same `EmbeddingCache` client
Phase 77 already built (same table, same `hash_text()` key). Real,
same-size effort as Phase 77 itself - not done opportunistically inside
that phase to avoid introducing a subtle sync/async bug in a path every
live query already depends on.

**Answer cache (Phase 78) has 3 confirmed, explicitly-scoped-out
follow-ups:**
- **Tier-2 semantic/similarity matching** - today's cache is exact-match
  only (the user's own confirmed starting scope). Two differently-worded
  questions with the same real answer currently miss the cache entirely.
- **Single/multi-agentic-rag answers aren't cached at all** - Phase 78
  only wired genai-rag's `pipeline.answer_query()` (the one pipeline with
  a plain, deterministic retrieve-then-generate path). Caching "the final
  answer" for an iterative tool-calling loop or a multi-agent dispatch is
  a different, bigger question - what's actually safe to treat as a pure
  function of the input - not resolved, not assumed answerable the same
  way.
- **Invalidation is blunt (clears the whole table on any document
  change), not per-document** - correct and safe, but more aggressive
  than necessary once there are many documents and most changes don't
  actually affect most cached answers. A real refinement if the blunt
  version turns out too costly in practice (frequent re-indexing against
  a large cache) - not a problem yet at this project's current scale.

## Observability gap: genai-rag's own generation calls are invisible (confirmed Phase 79, 2026-10-05)

**`response_generator.py` has zero token/cost/latency telemetry, unlike
the 3 agent files Phase 66 covered.** Confirmed live: `response
.usage_metadata` is `None` on every call through `GatewayChatModel` -
`GatewayChatModel._generate()` calls `OpenAIChatClient.ask()`, which only
ever returns the plain answer string, discarding the real OpenAI response
object (and its `usage` field) before `GatewayChatModel` ever sees it.
Also confirmed not picked up by LangSmith either - `OpenAIChatClient`
calls the raw `openai` SDK directly, never wrapped with `langsmith
.wrappers.wrap_openai()`, so `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` doesn't see these
calls regardless of whether tracing is on. This means genai-rag's own
query endpoint - the most heavily used one in this project - has **no**
token/cost visibility anywhere, a real hole Phase 66 didn't close since
it only touched `planner_agent.py`/`reviewer_agent.py`/
`orchestration_agent.py`. Fix needs either exposing `ask()`'s underlying
response object (a larger change - `ask()` is called from several places
expecting a plain string today) or wrapping `OpenAIChatClient`'s real
`openai.OpenAI` client with `wrap_openai()` for LangSmith visibility
without changing `ask()`'s own return type. Not started.

## Release gate follow-up (confirmed scope after Phase 80, 2026-10-05)

**`eval-gate.yml`/`scripts/run_release_gate.py` cover genai-rag only.**
Single/multi-agentic-rag each already have their own real eval adapters
(Phase 69's `ask_single_agentic_rag()`/`ask_multi_agentic_rag()`) and
could get their own release-gate pass using the exact same pattern Phase
80 just proved out - same `GATE_METRICS` reasoning would apply too (their
own retrieved-context shape differs from genai-rag's chunk list, so the
same precision@k structural-ceiling question would need re-checking, not
assumed to carry over automatically). Not started - a natural, same-shape
follow-up, not bundled into Phase 80 to keep it reviewable as one real,
already-complex CI job.

**`calculate_retrieval_metrics()`'s `k=3` default vs. this project's real
`top_k` is a standing mismatch worth a permanent decision, not just a
one-script workaround.** Phase 80's own script passes the real `k`
explicitly and then excludes precision/f1 from gating entirely (confirmed
with the user) - but `golden_dataset_harness.py`'s shared `score_case()`
still hardcodes `k=3` for every *other* caller
(`test_golden_dataset_harness.py`, `test_single_agentic_rag_golden_dataset
.py`, `test_multi_agentic_rag_golden_dataset.py`), all of which are
light smoke tests today ("confirms real scores come back, not a quality
gate") and don't fail on a low precision score - so this hasn't broken
anything yet, but the same structural ceiling applies there too, silently.
Worth a real decision later: expose `k` as a `score_case()` parameter
(default `3`, course-faithful, opt-in override), or reconsider whether
precision@k belongs in this project's own metric set at all given its
deliberately broad multi-chunk retrieval design. Not decided, not touched
in Phase 80 - that phase's own user instruction was explicitly to leave
`golden_dataset_harness.py` itself untouched.

## Indexing failures are silent to the API caller (confirmed Phase 83, 2026-10-05)

`documents_service.py` catches any exception from the indexing step
(`ai/doc_processing/pipeline.py`) and logs it as `ERROR`, but the upload's
own HTTP response still reports `"status": "uploaded"` for that document -
not `"failed"`. Found for real during Phase 83 (a missing
`llama-index-embeddings-openai` pin broke every indexing attempt for an
unknown period, completely silently - the API never once returned
anything other than `"uploaded"`). The dependency bug is fixed; this is
the separate, still-open design gap it exposed: a caller (a script, a
future React UI, a human in Postman) currently has no way to tell "fully
indexed and searchable" apart from "uploaded but indexing silently failed"
without reading CloudWatch/application logs by hand. Worth a real decision
later: should `DocumentUploadResponse`'s per-file `status` distinguish
`"uploaded"` (saved, not yet confirmed indexed) from `"indexed"`/
`"indexing_failed"`? Not decided, not touched in Phase 83 - that phase's
scope was strictly the missing dependency pin.

## Pinecone relevance threshold is a data-backed stop-gap, not a final calibration (Phase 83 follow-up, 2026-10-05)

`RAG_MIN_PINECONE_SCORE` was `0.5`, which sat right at the boundary of real
data rather than below it - confirmed by querying Pinecone directly for 20
real golden-dataset questions: scores ranged 0.4969-0.8229, with the
lowest *correct* match at 0.4969 (just under the old threshold - would
have been incorrectly filtered). Lowered to `0.45` in both local `.env`
and the live App Runner config, giving real margin below the observed
minimum. This is a deliberate stop-gap, not a finished calibration - the
sample only confirmed where *correct* matches score, not where irrelevant
noise starts scoring too high. Worth a real calibration later: run queries
expected to have no good answer in the KB, find the real separation
point between signal and noise, and ideally do this through the
golden-dataset release gate once it also exercises Pinecone (see
`docs/dev-reference/deployment-guide/03-pinecone-standard.html`'s open
question on extending `eval-gate.yml` beyond ChromaDB) rather than a
one-off manual check like this one.

## ~~Chunk metadata's `filename` field reads `"unknown"` in Pinecone~~ - resolved incidentally, Phase 87, 2026-10-06

Found Phase 83 (2026-10-05): every source chunk returned `"filename":
"unknown"` instead of the real PDF name. Resolved as a side effect of
Phase 87's clean Pinecone-namespace-clear + full re-ingest (done to fix
the metadata-store switch, not to fix this) - confirmed live, every
retrieved source now carries the real PDF name. Never root-caused
directly; most likely the original "unknown" values came from documents
ingested under an earlier code path (before some metadata-patching change
landed) and never got backfilled - a fresh ingest under current code
simply doesn't have the bug. Not worth further investigation now that
it's confirmed gone.
