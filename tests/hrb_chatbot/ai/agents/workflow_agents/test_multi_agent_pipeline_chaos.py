"""Chaos/failure-injection testing (Phase 74) - the real backend-down cases
were already seen by accident during Phase 64/67/70's own live testing
(hrb_lms_mcp genuinely unreachable) but never exercised by a deliberate,
repeatable test. This deliberately forces one domain agent to fail and
confirms the other agents' real results still reach the Reviewer, and the
final answer stays coherent - not that the whole graph fails closed."""
