# Write a new spec

This project has no separate `specs/` folder - a spec is a `**Spec:**` block
written into the target phase's own bullet in `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md`'s
`## Phases` section, **before** that phase's code starts. `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md`
stays both the plan and the history in one file, matching how every phase in
it already works - a spec is just that same bullet, written earlier in the
phase's lifecycle instead of only after the fact.

**One deliberate exception, added 2026-09-20:** a phase touching any
endpoint's request/response shape gets that shape confirmed in
`docs/agent-reference/endpoint-request-response-contracts.md` *first*, iterated on there
directly with the user until every sub-object is marked **Finalized**,
*before* this phase's own `**Spec:**` block is written. That file is a
second source of truth on purpose, not a drift - endpoint shapes get
renegotiated over many turns before a phase number even exists, and folding
that back-and-forth into one phase's bullet made it unreadable. The phase's
own spec then just points at it (see Phase 45's entry for the pattern).

## Steps

1. Find the target phase's `- [ ]` bullet in `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md`'s
   `## Phases` section (or, if promoting a `docs/agent-reference/BACKLOG.md` item, add a new
   `- [ ]` bullet at the end of that section using the same
   `**Phase N (status) — Title.**` opening format every other bullet uses).
2. If this phase touches any endpoint's request/response shape, confirm it
   in `docs/agent-reference/endpoint-request-response-contracts.md` first (add a new section
   marked "Proposed, awaiting confirmation", flip to "Finalized" once the
   user agrees) - do this before step 3, not after.
3. Append a nested `**Spec:**` sub-list to that bullet, using this template -
   omit a line if it's genuinely not applicable, but say so explicitly
   ("N/A - ...") rather than leaving it out silently:

   ```
   - **Spec:**
     - **Context:** why this phase, what triggered it.
     - **Data/API contracts:** point at the relevant, now-Finalized section
       of `docs/agent-reference/endpoint-request-response-contracts.md` - name the actual
       Pydantic model(s) in `src/hrb_chatbot/models/` too, but the wire
       shape itself lives in that file, not repeated here.
     - **User-visible behavior:** what a caller can do after this phase that
       they couldn't before.
     - **Failure modes:** what's expected to go wrong and what the endpoint
       returns for each (status code + `error_codes.py` code).
     - **Retrieval quality criteria** (only for phases touching chunking/
       indexing/retrieval): chunking strategy and size, top-k/threshold,
       which `resources/golden_dataset/golden_dataset.json` rows cover it.
     - **Out of scope:** what this phase deliberately does not do.
     - **Open questions:** anything that needs a decision before or during
       implementation.
   ```

4. Set that phase's checkbox to `- [ ]` (not started) if it isn't already,
   and leave the "Status at a glance" table row's Status column as
   `📋 Planned` (or add the row if it's a newly promoted BACKLOG item).
5. Do not write any implementation code in this step. Report the spec back
   to the user for review before anything in `src/` changes - matches the
   "one task at a time" rule in `CLAUDE.md`.

## What "done" looks like

The phase's bullet in `docs/agent-reference/RAG-ROADMAP.md` now has a `**Spec:**` sub-list,
committed on its own before implementation starts, so the spec is reviewable
independent of any code diff.
