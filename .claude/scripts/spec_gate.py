"""PreToolUse hook for hrb_chatbot_v2 - blocks a Write/Edit under
src/hrb_chatbot/** unless at least one phase in docs/RAG-ROADMAP.md has a
written, not-yet-done spec.

Deliberately scoped to src/hrb_chatbot/** only (via `should_gate` below) -
never .claude/, tests/, or docs/ - so this hook can never lock out fixing
itself, writing tests, or writing the next spec. See CLAUDE.md's SDD
section for why a *written* spec is the bar, not a matching-scope spec:
this hook cannot verify a given edit falls inside a spec's declared
boundary, only that some spec is in flight. That's implementer.md's job
("stay inside the phase's declared scope"), not this hook's.

Detection: scans docs/RAG-ROADMAP.md's "## Phases" section for a top-level
"- [ ]" bullet (not yet done) that has a nested "- **Spec:**" sub-item
(see .claude/skills/spec-new/SKILL.md for the format). Any match -> allow.

Run manually with: python .claude/scripts/spec_gate.py < payload.json
